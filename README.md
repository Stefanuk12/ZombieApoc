# Zombie Apoc
This is a text-based game that is similar to Dungeons and Dragons.

## To do
- Add more events
- Add items?
- Add HP system, etc
- 
## Plan
My plan on making this game:

### Getting user input
- Support for nested menus
- Allow for exiting current menu (assuming we can)

### Events
- ~36 possible events (including every possible combination)
- Each event can have "sub-events" where the player game have more choices. Similar to a menu
